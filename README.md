## 🚀 Professional Summary

I’m a dedicated full-stack engineer passionate about building intuitive, powerful web applications that solve real-world problems. With a strong technical foundation from App Academy’s rigorous 1,000+ hour full-stack curriculum and a 4.0 GPA in Computer Science, I excel at rapidly mastering new technologies and turning complex challenges into scalable solutions.

Previously, I've successfully launched fintech-inspired projects such as **GetRichQwik** (a Robinhood-style paper trading simulator with real-time data integration) and **Cash with Friends** (a collaborative expense-splitting platform), demonstrating my ability to manage end-to-end application development and effective team collaboration.

My diverse background—from psychology to sales at Google and security at Meta—enables me to blend technical expertise with strong communication skills, exceptional problem-solving capabilities, and a keen understanding of user experience.
